# Container Attached Storage

In CAS or Container Attached Storage architecture, storage runs within containers and is closely associated with the application that the storage is bound to. Storage runs as micro service and will have no Kernel module dependencies. Orchestration systems such as Kubernetes orchestrates the storage volume like any other micro services or container. CAS provides benefits of both DAS and NAS.
