# OpenEBS Architecture

OpenEBS follows the container attached storage or CAS model. As a part of this approach, each volume has a dedicated controller POD and a set of replica PODs. The advantages of the CAS architecture are discussed on the CNCF blog here. OpenEBS is simple to operate and to use largely because it looks and feels like other cloud-native and Kubernetes friendly projects.
